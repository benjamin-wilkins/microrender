    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      This is an example to (hopefully) run the same JS
      client-side and server-side in two different
      environments to produce the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JS will display the time below:
    </p>
    <div id="timeBox"></div>
    <script id="send-fragment-js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      import Renderer from "/microrender.js";

      const renderer = new Renderer({js: window.fragmentJS, root: document.documentElement});
      window.setInterval(() => {renderer.render()}, 1000);
    </script>
  </body>
